// Minimal Passing Functions and Unit Tests can be used together to help you organize your development process.

// Unit Test
// A unit test is the fundamental component of any testing strategy.
// This week we will discuss how to write basic ones in pure javascript
// Unit tests can be used as part of a well organized development process 
//  to hold yourself to your own standards and to keep yourself focused. (single-purpose functions)

// Minimal Passing Functions
// Simplest possible functions play an important role in the structured approach to development we teach.
// By planning ahead the architecture and specs of your project, you can break down the development 
//  process into solving several isolated and manageable chunks. 
// Each of these chunks can be built up using the Minimal Passing paradigm to trouble shoot your app
//  from the first line of code to the last.

// Simplest passing functions will become very important next week when we begin developing multi-object apps.



// Testing and it's role in larger-scale development is a whole nother discussion.
// We will be looking at Test Driven Development in week 6.
// This series of exercises is simply an introduction to what tests are.
